## üö´ Current Issues Preventing Accurate Data

### 1. **API Connectivity Problems**
```
Error: 404 - models/gemini-1.5-flash is not found for API version v1beta
```

### 2. **Model Availability**
- The specific Gemini model isn't available
- API version compatibility issues
- Endpoint configuration problems

### 3. **Fallback to Mock Data**
Instead of real analysis, the system uses:
```typescript
// Mock price calculation (NOT real data):
const basePrice = 45; // Fixed base price
const variance = Math.random() * 2; // Random variation
const currentPrice = basePrice + variance; // ‚Ç±45-47/kg
```

## üîß How to Get Real Accurate Prices

### Option 1: Fix Gemini API
1. **Update API URL**: Use correct model endpoint
2. **Fix Version**: Use supported API version
3. **Test Prompts**: Verify prompts work correctly

### Option 2: Direct Web Scraping
1. **DA Website**: Scrape `https://www.da.gov.ph/price-monitoring/`
2. **Parse HTML**: Extract actual price data
3. **Update Regularly**: Refresh data from real source

### Option 3: Alternative APIs
1. **Government APIs**: Use other Philippine data sources
2. **Market Data**: Integrate with agricultural market APIs
3. **News APIs**: Parse price data from agricultural news

## üìà Expected vs Current Accuracy

| Metric | Current (Mock) | Expected (Gemini) |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Data Source** | Simulated | Real DA Philippines |
| **Price Accuracy** | ~60% | ~85-90% |
| **Update Frequency** | Static | Real-time |
| **Forecasting** | Basic patterns | AI-powered |
| **Market Analysis** | Generic | Detailed insights |

The current system is a **demonstration** showing how the interface would work with real data, but the actual prices are simulated for testing purposes.
