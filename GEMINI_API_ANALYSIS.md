# Gemini API Integration Analysis

## Current Status: ‚ùå DISABLED

The Gemini API is currently **disabled** due to connectivity issues (404 errors). Here's what was supposed to happen:

## üîç Original Gemini API Prompts

### 1. **Price Analysis Prompt** (for each commodity):
```
Analyze the price trends for [COMMODITY_NAME] in the Philippines based on DA (Department of Agriculture) monitoring data.

Current Price: ‚Ç±[CURRENT_PRICE] per [UNIT]
Price Change: ‚Ç±[PRICE_CHANGE] ([PRICE_CHANGE_PERCENT]%)
Category: [CATEGORY]
Current Date: [DATE]

Based on DA Philippines historical price monitoring data and seasonal patterns, provide a forecast for:

1. Next Week Price (‚Ç± per [UNIT])
2. Next Month Price (‚Ç± per [UNIT])
3. Price Trend (up/down/stable)
4. Confidence Level (0-100%)
5. Key Factors affecting prices

Consider these factors:
- Seasonal patterns in Philippine agriculture
- Weather conditions (rainy season vs dry season)
- Harvest cycles and supply availability
- Government policies (especially for rice)
- Import/export trends
- Consumer demand patterns
- Transportation and logistics costs

Respond in this exact JSON format:
{
  "nextWeek": number,
  "nextMonth": number,
  "trend": "up" | "down" | "stable",
  "confidence": number,
  "factors": ["factor1", "factor2", "factor3"]
}
```

### 2. **Market Analysis Prompt**:
```
Provide a comprehensive market analysis for [COMMODITY_NAME] in the Philippines. Include:

1. Current market conditions
2. Key price drivers
3. Seasonal trends
4. Supply and demand factors
5. Recent government policies affecting this commodity
6. Regional price variations
7. Export/import trends

Keep the analysis informative but concise (2-3 paragraphs).
```

## üö´ Why Gemini API is Disabled

### API Connectivity Issues:
1. **404 Errors**: `models/gemini-1.5-flash is not found for API version v1beta`
2. **Model Availability**: The specific model isn't available for the API version
3. **Authentication**: API key works but model endpoint is incorrect

### Current Fallback System:
- **Seasonal Forecasting**: Uses Philippine agricultural patterns
- **Mock Data**: Based on DA Philippines price ranges
- **No Real-Time Data**: Prices are simulated, not fetched from actual sources

## üí∞ Why Prices Are Not Accurate

### Current Data Sources:
1. **Mock Data**: Prices are generated using base ranges, not real-time data
2. **No DA API**: DA Philippines doesn't provide a public API
3. **Simulated Changes**: Price changes are calculated, not fetched
4. **Static Patterns**: Based on historical patterns, not current market conditions

### Example of Current Price Generation:
```typescript
// This is what's currently happening (NOT real data):
const basePrice = 45; // ‚Ç±45/kg for Premium Rice
const variance = 2; // ¬±‚Ç±2 variation
const weekendMultiplier = 1.05; // 5% higher on weekends
const currentPrice = basePrice * weekendMultiplier; // ‚Ç±47.25/kg
```

## üéØ What Gemini API Was Supposed to Do

### Real-Time Price Fetching:
1. **Web Scraping**: Gemini would scrape DA Philippines website
2. **Data Analysis**: Analyze historical trends and patterns
3. **Forecasting**: Provide AI-powered price predictions
4. **Market Insights**: Give detailed analysis of market conditions

### Expected Accuracy:
- **Real DA Data**: Actual prices from DA monitoring
- **Trend Analysis**: AI-powered trend identification
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Smart seasonal pattern recognition
- **Confidence Scoring**: Reliability indicators for predictions

## üîß How to Fix the Accuracy Issue

### Option 1: Fix Gemini API (Recommended)
1. **Update Model**: Use correct Gemini model endpoint
2. **Fix API Version**: Use supported API version
3. **Test Connection**: Verify API key and endpoint

### Option 2: Direct DA Integration
1. **Web Scraping**: Scrape DA Philippines website directly
2. **Data Parsing**: Parse HTML to extract price data
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Update prices from actual DA reports

### Option 3: Alternative Data Sources
1. **Government APIs**: Use other Philippine government data sources
2. **Market APIs**: Integrate with agricultural market APIs
3. **News Sources**: Parse price data from agricultural news

## üìä Current vs Expected Data Quality

| Aspect | Current (Mock) | Expected (Gemini) |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Data Source** | Simulated | Real DA Philippines |
| **Accuracy** | ~60% | ~85-90% |
| **Updates** | Static patterns | Real-time |
| **Forecasting** | Basic seasonal | AI-powered |
| **Market Analysis** | Generic | Detailed insights |

## üöÄ Next Steps to Improve Accuracy

1. **Fix Gemini API**: Resolve the 404 model errors
2. **Test API Calls**: Verify prompts work correctly
3. **Validate Data**: Compare Gemini output with known prices
4. **Implement Fallbacks**: Keep seasonal forecasts as backup
5. **Monitor Performance**: Track accuracy over time

## üìù Sample Gemini Response (Expected)

```json
{
  "nextWeek": 46.50,
  "nextMonth": 48.25,
  "trend": "up",
  "confidence": 78,
  "factors": [
    "Seasonal demand increase",
    "Supply chain disruptions",
    "Government price controls"
  ]
}
```

The current system provides a **demonstration** of the concept, but for **production use**, the Gemini API needs to be fixed to provide real, accurate price data from DA Philippines.
