# APK Build Instructions for AgriAssist

## Current Issue
The EAS build is failing due to dependency installation issues. Here are several alternative approaches to get your APK:

## Option 1: Manual EAS Build (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://expo.dev/accounts/jayshuagarcia/projects/agriassist/builds
2. Click "Create a new build"
3. Select "Android" platform
4. Select "Preview" profile
5. Click "Create build"

## Option 2: Fix Dependencies and Retry
The build is failing during dependency installation. Try these steps:

1. **Clean install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   ```

2. **Update Expo CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @expo/cli@latest
   ```

3. **Try building again:**
   ```bash
   eas build --platform android --profile preview
   ```

## Option 3: Use Expo Go (Quick Testing)
1. Install Expo Go app on your phone
2. Run: `npx expo start`
3. Scan the QR code with Expo Go
4. Test the app directly on your phone

## Option 4: Local Development Build
1. Install Android Studio
2. Set up Android SDK
3. Use: `npx expo run:android`

## Option 5: Alternative Build Service
Consider using:
- **Appetize.io** for web-based testing
- **Expo Snack** for quick prototyping
- **React Native CLI** for local builds

## Current Build Status
